# Bio
* I am a research scientist of Microsoft STCA (Software Technology Center at Asia).
* I earned my Master’s Degree in Software Engineering from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020.
* My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval, and multimodal pre-training. More details, please refer to [Publications](https://victorsungo.github.io/publications/) tab.
* For years, I contribute core deep models for [Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com/?scope=web&mkt=en-US), [Microsoft XiaoIce (微软小冰)](https://www.xiaoice.com/) and [Microsoft Start](https://www.msn.com/en-us/feed).

# Hiring

I'm always looking for highly self-motivated students to work with me as research interns. Please email me (qins AT microsoft DOT com) if you have good coding skills and are passionate about deep learning and natural language processing.
