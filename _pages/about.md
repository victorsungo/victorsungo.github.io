# Biography
* I am an applied scientist of Microsoft STCA (Software Technology Center at Asia).
* I earned my Master’s Degree in Software Engineering from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020.
* My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and multimodal learning. 
<!-- * More details, please refer to [Publications](https://victorsungo.github.io/publications/) tab. -->
* For years, I contribute core deep models for [Microsoft Start](https://www.msn.com/en-us/feed), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/?scope=web&mkt=en-US), and [XiaoIce (微软小冰)](https://www.xiaoice.com/).

<!-- # Hiring

I'm always looking for highly self-motivated students to work with me as research interns. Please email me if you are passionate about natural language processing. -->
